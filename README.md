A simple library for controlling LED-strips and rings with Raspberry Pi.<br/>
With it, you can make an LED-strip / -ring such as
[Switch Science](https://www.switch-science.com) [SSCI-014007](http://ssci.to/1400) and [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) [NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) glitter using a Raspberry Pi.

The library is written in C,
and you can use it on Python (using [ctypes](https://docs.python.jp/3/library/ctypes.html))
or on Node.js (as a native add-on).

Note: [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) provides
[a library for RaspPi + NeoPixel](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/software),
which may be a better solution for the purpose of controlling LED-strips and rings on Raspberry Pi.
A petit raison d'etre of my library is its smallness and simplicity.


## Quick Start

Connect the Data-In port of an LED-strip or ring to the GPIO #18
(in [the GPIO numbering](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio-plus-and-raspi2/), 
not in the physical numbering) pin of a Raspberry Pi
(If you use a Raspberry Pi 1 or Zero, then please see the note below).
Also connect the +5V and GND ports of the strip or ring to the 5V and GND pins of the Raspberry Pi, respectively.

Then, turn on the Raspberry Pi and run the following commands:

```sh
$ make                # compile .c files
$ sudo ./sample.py    # run a sample program
$ sudo ./rainbow.py   # run another sample program
```

Note:

 - For Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero, please change the value of `PI_VERSION` in `pwmfifo.c` into 1 and then run `make` (Note that I have only tested this library on Raspberry Pi 3).
 - Please change the value of `N_LED` in the Python programs according to the number of LEDs on your strip or ring (e.g. 10 LEDs on the strip in the above left-hand photo; 12 LEDs on the ring in the above right-hand photo).
 - To use a GPIO pin other than #18, change the value of `LED_GPIO` in the Python programs. However, you can only use GPIO #12, 13, 18, or 19 (that can be connected to the hardware PWM).
 - Initially this library is configured for WS2812B controller (one bit per 1.25&micro;s; output High for 0.4&micro;s and 0.8&micro;s to represent 0 and 1, respectively). If your LED strip needs different settings, please change parameters defined in `serialled.c`.

### For Node.js

You need [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) to build a Node.js Addon of this library.<br/>
Install node-gyp and then run the following commands:

```sh
$ node-gyp configure build    # build the addon
$ sudo node addon-test.js     # run a testing script
```

  - Python
    - sample.py -- a sample program
    - rainbow.py -- another sample program
    - beep.py -- yet another sample program that beep a piezo speaker using the other PWM channel
  - C
    - serialled.c -- a library for controlling serial LED strips. It depends on pwmfifo.c.
    - pwmfifo.c -- a [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com)-like library for using the FIFO of the PWM. It depends on mailbox.c.
    - mailbox.c -- (c) Broadcom Europe Ltd. It defines functions for allocating memory and getting the bus address of it.
    - Makefile -- used for compiling the above C files.
  - Node.js
    - addon.cc -- It makes the functions in serialled.c visible from Node.js.
    - binding.gyp -- a build setting file for addon.cc ([node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) is required).
    - addon-test.js -- a testing script of addon.cc.

You can call the functions of this library from your Python script using
[ctypes](https://docs.python.jp/3/library/ctypes.html).
Consult sample.py and rainbow.py for the usage of the library functions.
All functions of this library take int arguments.

(This library does not depend on Python or JavaScript. I think it is not difficult to use the functions on other languages.)

## Internals

([More details in Japanese](https://github.com/kut-tktlab/serial-led-pi/wiki/Pwm).)

It transmits PWM signals to an LED-strip or ring by providing data to the PWM hardware
using [DMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Memory_Access) (in pwmfifo.c).

- Relatively high-speed transmission is required
(for WS2812B, 1bit / 1.25 &micro;s = 0.8 Mbps). Moreover, we have to transmit several handreds of bits (= N_LED &times; 24) without intermission.
- So, providing data to the PWM by CPU (earlier commits of this library was doing so) was not a good idea; it sometimes failed to be in time.

To use DMA,
we have to know the *physical* address of memory.
This library uses mailbox.c to allocate memory in the physical address space and to obtain the address of that memory.
